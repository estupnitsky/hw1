    <h1>Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada</h1>
      <p>To be completely honest, I don't need to go to Lake Louise in particular. Anything with tree-lined mountains that end in water will do.</p>
      <p>I could see this scene in Lake Tahoe or the Norwegian fjords, but I chose Lake Louise and that's a choice we're all just going to have to accept.</p>
